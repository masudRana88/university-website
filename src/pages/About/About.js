                A mission statement clarifies what the company wants to achieve, who they want to support, and why they want to support them.

                The Life is Good brand is about more than spreading optimism â€” although, with uplifting T-shirt slogans like "Seas The Day" and "Forecast: Mostly Sunny," it's hard not to crack a smile.

                There are tons of T-shirt companies in the world, but Life is Good's mission sets itself apart with a mission statement that goes beyond fun clothing: to spread the power of optimism.
